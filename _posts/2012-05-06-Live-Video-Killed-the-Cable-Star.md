_A new device aims to change the cable TV landscape_

If there’s one thing many modern media consumers hate, it’s being locked in, whether to a cellphone company contract, or a cable tv package. As it stands, cable TV services lock people into paying a premium for the few channels that they do watch. Support for mobile devices and internet streaming is limited at best. Want to watch Mad Men? Depending on where you live, you have to be ready to pony up for Verizon Fios. Want to watch the Walking Dead on your iPad? Well, AMC is not on the list of channels Verizon Fios allows for streaming. Want to watch channels you’ve paid for at a different location? Well, that’s just out of the question.

This is where services like Aereo come in. Basically, Aereo amounts to paying $12 a month for a tiny antenna that sends and receives HD broadcast signals, controlled by a remote DVR. Each antenna only transmits to one person at a time, thereby sidestepping the issue of piracy. Currently, Aereo is only accessible in New York City on select devices but plans are underfoot to expand to other media markets and devices. 

Despite the rise of Netflix and Hulu and other such providers, legal consumption of most media through non-traditional channels is difficult. Set-top boxes will do the job but involve a higher cost and hassle. Aereo aims to do the same without adding on any bothersome new boxes or cables. Aereo would open up live broadcast TV to the internet through the purchase of a small, easy-to-use device. Consumers are now able to, essentially, own a TV antenna hooked up to the internet, which will allow them to receive TV signals on their mobile device. Remote DVR even allows for cloud-based recording for the morning after. 

Predictably, Aereo is getting sued before its launch. The National Association of Broadcasters recently released a terse statement strongly supporting legal action, making veiled threats about the further availability of their content. 

At a time when cable companies are fighting to restrict access to content, services like Aereo represent a challenge for the status quo. It is well-established that content providers have not yet figured out how to effectively monetize the web. Switching to a cloud-based model may indeed make that even more difficult. One may well argue that the success of the big channels in the bundle is what allows for the existence of the minor channels and niche shows but that is an argument that cable companies are destined to lose as more and more consumers cut the cord and demand cloud-based service. This is the argument that Aereo and it’s founder, TV honcho, Barry Diller, founder of the USA Network, are responding to, backed by a much deeper set of pockets than other startups before them. 

Like it or not, whether or not Aereo survives, its plug and play model is the future of broadcast TV.
