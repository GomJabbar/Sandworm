Lorca’s lover always wore red. Many nights, the poet lay in bed touching the places his Moorish lover had been, teasing out the poems buried there. At first, they rose out of him, ecstatic, until they, like his lover, stopped coming, dammed as the river Amarguillo at Consuegra. All that remained of the Moor was a vague red tinge under Lorca’s skin somewhere. You have loved me and left me, the poet said, and danced the rhumba, which like him, is sadder than it seems. 

Frantic and alone, Lorca took the midnight plane out of Sevilla. Once on the plane, he found himself slicing into the flesh of his forearm with a plastic knife, the flight attendant’s panic only alleviated when she realized that what was spilling over the aisle was not blood, but drops of poetry. That’s just beautiful, she said, cut the other one. His whitening skin serving as a reminder of what had been, the memory of each summer’s night a Reconquista hurrying down his body’s canvas. 

Harlem, the collapsed artery of this nameless city. That’s where he would go to forget. 
You dance like you mean it, accused his first American patron, the Lady Noah. I’m not sure the public needs to see your poetry, but perhaps, perhaps. Just remember, this is a job interview, not a game, Mister Lorca, remember that. She then shook her head, liberating a single white curl from behind her ear. The whip arm for Caliban’s blues, she said to no one in particular, such a great and terrible thing. 

At first, Lorca was not the Lady’s lover, only the bellhop at her dayglo hotel. Everyday, he carried her Francesco Biasia Ruby Double Handle tote bag up three flights of stairs. Every night, she commanded him, dance, and he did, being only a bellhop, with a razor between his teeth and his canvas shoes from Duende. He routinely sliced himself into poems.

Afterwards, when enough Saturdays had passed, she came to think of him as not just her bellhop, but an extension of the hotel she owned, and grew to love him like her own. She began to live inside him, coaxing dirty poems from beneath his tattooed pink skin, upbraiding bottles of Jamaican rum from his minibar. Tell me everything. Her knife singing into the hollow of his throat. The red had mostly faded by now.

Lorca’s other lover during this period was a shapeshifter at the Cotton Club who saw him in every tempest that long hot summer (quizas, it was 1964). Her sanguine hopes, of poetry and romance, flickered like cat’s eyes but coaxed no affection from the poet whose skin had acquired, by then, a sort of translucent sheen from regular poem loss. How dare you withhold yourself from us? His lovers asked, to no avail. Between blasts of trumpet, they wrote a letter to the Lady Noah, delivered it pinned to a Serrano Ham.

When the Lady caught up to the fleeing Lorca somewhere over Alfacar, she stripped his skin like a bacon rind, bloodless.
