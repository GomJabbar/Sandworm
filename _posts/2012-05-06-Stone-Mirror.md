**THE STONE MIRROR**

I came to this city from the garden countries of the far South where it had become untenable for a man such as myself to exist. After a long journey lasting several months, I arrived here in the post-life country of Tlon on the vessel “L’Espoir,” a merchant ship that had as its cargo a shipment of rare birds from Molucca. Exactly sixteen months ago to this day. I carried in my possession proof not of my identity but the proof of my purpose. The story I am about to tell you will detail the terrible events that followed my arrival in Sharm-Al-Khayaal. 

Sharm-Al-Khayaal, or the Port of Consideration, occupies a five mile stretch along a narrow Tlonian peninsula that juts out into the Eastern Hind Ocean. From time immemorial, it has served as a port of call for sailors making their way from the continents of Europe and Africa to the rich hinterlands of Molucca. Since its inception, Sharm-Al-Khayaal has served as the seat of all Tlonian learning.  Sharm-Al-Khayaal is where Maimonides wrote his famous “Guide to the Post-Life.” Scholars from all over the world flock to Sharm-Al-Khayaal in the humid summer months to get away from the chatter of Rome and the tedium of Shiraz. Here, they come seeking a peculiar sort of knowledge, one pertaining primarily to matters of faith that are uniquely Ibadhi. What sort of faith must we possess when God is constantly remaking the universe at every instant yet his laws are eternal and cannot be disobeyed? That is the question animating all Ibadhi research, whether in life or in the post-life. 

Some men, on the other hand, come to Sharm-Al-Khayaal seeking a final form of death which some reports say can be had in its vicinity, in the maelstroms of the Hind Ocean or within the vast starshot emptiness of the Rub-Al-Khali.  Sharm-Al-Khayaal was the port where the famous post-life philosopher Andre Neher was swallowed by the sea, never to be heard from again. 

Sharm-Al-Khayaal is divided into two sections, Old town and New town, each containing a central square ringed by a series of six mosques. Each town contains within it the same number of stores and other amenities. Qualitatively, one might say Old town and New town are indistinguishable from one another. Both possess exceedingly narrow vein-like streets that cut through stacks of mud-baked houses, each built seemingly at random, some perched precariously on their neighbors while others stand at a distance. To say there is little order in Sharm-Al-Khayaal would be a massive understatement. To say I came seeking some sort of order would be a similar sort of understatement. I was looking for an answer though of course, as you will see, the question I wanted the answer to, had long since become opaque to me through an act of my own will. These are the events of my tragedy.

When I first came across the child, I was wandering along the Corniche of Old Town, skipping across the tops of the polished white columns that form the causeway protecting the Sharm-Al-Khayaal harbor from the tides. Across my loose fitting robe, I had strapped the black bag that contained almost all my worldly possessions, including a book that had been passed down to me by a great scholar. I had never read from the book, fearing a great calamity were I to peruse its pages. 
The child, a dirty flaxen-haired imp of about ten or so, had been sitting on the pier for quite some time, sipping a clear beverage from a plastic cup, staring resolutely at me, leaving me no choice but to confront him. Decades of wandering through the post-life had sensitized me to the nuances of the human gaze. It was apparent to me he was interested in what I was carrying.  Noticing his interest in my possessions, I began yelling in the manner of an Ibadhi father chastising his kin for insufficient deference.

“What is in your bag?” the child wanted to know but I would not say. 

“Where are your parents? What would they think if they knew you were staring like this?” I asked, angrily. My anger, however, had no bearing on the intensity of the child’s gaze, which only strengthened in hostility, such that I could not help but clutch my black shoulder bag to my front as if to swallow it within the folds of my dusty jacket. A great warrior in fear of a child? Surely not, but the story turns only stranger. 

Nightfall came upon us two while we argued. The muezzin called the faithful to evening prayer. The Ibadhis, who made up most of the Tlonian populace, dispersed in their quiet manner towards the mosques that ringed the old Souq. Not the child, however, and it became apparent to me that he could not be of this nation, for Tlonian Ibadhis were renowned for being preternaturally pious. He did not possess the circular grey indentation the Tlonians acquire in life around the age of six or seven from pressing forehead to carpet five times a day in prayer. Furthermore, he was wearing jewelry, a simple gold bracelet on the left wrist, in the custom of the children of the East as well as some segments of society within the Garden States. Less trustworthy folk, they counted among their number most of the pickpockets and prostitutes of Tlon. Thus, I began to worry. 

“Do you know what you’re carrying?”

“What business is it of yours? Are you a thief? Well, I’ll have you know I’m good friends with the Chief of Police of Sharm-Al-Khayaal.”

The child only laughed at my lie, so I said nothing further, and walked away.

Time passed slowly. I was aware of his eyes on my back. There was something oddly familiar about his manner, a vengeful tinge within the gaze that gave me pause. Ratcheted up into a heightened paranoia, I fearfully sensed the subtle movements of every green blade of every date palm tree that stood beside the Souq. I walked hastily across the long core of light at the center of the promenade to the stalls that I knew were run by foreigners, atheists like me who understood that, after death, there was no place for the divine. Certainly, God, if He existed, was nothing like the Almighty the Ibadhis revered. After death, there was only more life, stretching as far as the eye could see and the mind could measure. Was it not ordained by the wisest of the Ancients that the sole purpose of our existence was merely to live? The human consciousness could do little else. 
The child followed. I had to remind myself that there was no way he could kill me or otherwise harm me. Nor was there anything I could do to him. After all, what is death to those that have already died? What is life to one that has already lived? At worst, a coma, a temporary cessation of brain activity. 

“Old man,” he called. His voice was high and sweet. “Have you read from the Book? Say yes so that you may grant us both peace.”

I broke into a run in the general direction of the library that I knew stood beside the Western gate of Sharm-Al-Khayaal. Therein I had friends, scholars and intellectuals who would protect me from the clutches of the child, who I knew in that moment to be among my persecutors. 

“Go away,” I called towards the child. “What I have is none of your business. All I have are some books. I am a writer, nothing more.”

The child did not seem to be listening. It edged ever closer, always at a safe distance, forever quizzical, its slight eyebrows knit together in a furrow of concentration that rippled down its arched beak of a nose.

“You don’t recognize me,” the child said. “Yet you have the Book. How is this possible?”

“No.”

“Yet you have the Book and I am in it.”

A sensation came to me unbidden, a memory almost, of a snake crawling from my navel into my heart, depositing a milky white drop there. “What book?” I asked, through clenched teeth.

“The Book of the Living.”

“What do you mean?”

“The Book of the Living,” the child repeated. “Tell me this, old man. Did you read from it?”

Did I reply? I could not tell. Perhaps I did. Perhaps I explained to my questioner the truth about my life: that I had committed some grave sin that had erased many of my life’s memories, leading me instead down a path of war. Perhaps I told the boy that the scholar who had entrusted the Book to me had promised me that the Book would make the nature of my torment clear to me but that I had not read from it for fear of learning the truth about myself. Perhaps I told the boy that once I had a wife and child whose faces I could not recall whose trail I’d relentlessly followed through my exile in the cities of the Post-Life. Perhaps, or perhaps not. Lightning flashed in the sky and a soft rain began to fall. My last sensation was of water’s soft touch on my face.  

In that moment, I lost consciousness and the Book of the Living was taken from me, never to be seen again. I awoke within a building I recognized immediately as the Sharm-Al-Khayaal Prison. 
The cell I was imprisoned in was perfectly hexagonal and contained three barred windows, each with their own view of the ocean, were I sufficiently strong to climb the bench and pull myself up to the bars. There was little furniture, only the bench and a low chair. Sunlight tumbled onto the packed mud floor of the cell through the three windows. In the corner were long-empty cans of food, shards of broken glass and bits of old desiccated newspapers that a previous inhabitant had left behind. Tiny holes had been drilled in the spaces between the stones of the wall by colonies of termites. The entire cell exuded a musty smell of laundry left too long in the dark. 

 I noticed with some relief that I was wearing the same clothes I had been when I’d fallen unconscious. I was even in possession of all the money I’d been carrying, a strange enough sign in itself, and further inspection of my person revealed that I was otherwise unharmed, save a crushing headache. However, my bag was missing. 

“Jailer,” I called, but there was no answer. Through the cell door, I could make out a multitude of hexagonal cells, all arranged around a hexagonal chamber. Fat shards of light filled the center of the chamber. Perhaps a spiral staircase wound its way upwards. Perhaps that was a trick of the light. Perhaps. 

The loneliness I felt in that first hour was rivaled only by my hunger, which was ravenous and without end. Together, they summoned from the deeps the face of the woman I had loved in life. She was young and beautiful and wore a blue dress held together by a blue ribbon in the front. I recognized the town we’d lived in, months before the barbarians invaded from the East. I saw her face snap out of its vigil as she turned towards me on the harbor road after another one of my voyages. She smiled as she passed the house we’d lived in then and as I watched her walk past me down the dusty road to buy some sugar, I considered how infinite sorrow and loss must be to span this length of time despite all my efforts at forgetting.

I reached my fingers through the bars, grasping at the oval that would have been her face. How many years did she continue living after my death? Was her sorrow visible in her smile in the years after? Would I recognize her if I saw her once more? I longed then to close my eyes and breathe in her scent. How difficult it was to overcome years and years of shadow and recapture memories grown faint with disuse. How difficult it was to go on living, past even life itself, simply because living was the only thing one knew to do. How easily I had forgotten that I too had a son of about ten, that he looked just like me, and that all I had hoped for was a better world for him, a better world for him to exist within, a better world not this one. A deep pain came to me, a sensation of smoke filling my lungs. I let my hands drop and hang loose from the bars of my cell. 

From the cell beside mine, I heard a woman’s voice cry out for me. 

“Harmon,” it said.

Surely, there weren’t many other men named Harmon in this country. “Who are you?” I said suddenly and grew resentful for the interjection. “How do you know my name?” I called back.

“That’s not important right now. What time is it? Do you know?”

“I don’t have a watch.”

“Bastard! Another hopeless case, I see.”

“Wait,” I said, and hurried to the windows from where I could ascertain the position of the sun.
 
Many months at sea had prepared me well for such an eventuality. “Late afternoon,” I said.

“Do you think it’s closer to three or four? We may only speak freely when it is four even though today is the Ibadhi day of rest.”

I shook my head. I recalled vague stories I had heard in my travels about the eccentricities of the prison at Sharm-Al-Khayaal. “Why is that?” I asked.

“The Ibadhis will be at evening prayer then and will not be monitoring our conversation. You’re lucky to be awake today. Friday is the day of Speech, the only day when the air is not heavy with the Ibadhi drone. No words can rise above the Ibadhi drone which, mercifully, they turn off on Friday though they still monitor us except during that one period. You can speak freely, except on the topic of _____, which can only be spoken about at those hours on this day.”
Even though she did not say the word for _____, I knew exactly what she was referring to. _____, the one word that was banned from Ibadhi public discourse.

“Three-thirty would be my best guess,” I said. “The angle of the sun cannot be accurately told from here. It seems to me that our cells are somehow tilted forward in space. The precise angle of the tilt is unknown to me so I must hesitate to offer a firm answer.”

“We will know soon enough. I have to ask you a few questions, see exactly how much you know about the forbidden subjects. If you get this wrong, you will lose your tongue for speaking about matters that are deemed unnecessary in Tlon. In a half hour, you will say the forbidden word, if you know what it is. Only then can we be sure that you’re one among us. For now, simply contemplate the stone mirror that is the sixth wall of your cell.”

My stomach growled and forced me to sit down. “Yes,” I said. “In a half hour.”

 I ran my fingers along the thick stone walls of my prison. I rested my cheek against the far wall, where a confluence of cool ocean breeze and cold stone could chill both sides of my face.

“Oh, my life,” I sighed. The wall farthest from me in this position, that is to say, the wall to the left of the door, seemed to shimmer for just a second, as I spoke. Within it, I glimpsed a room within which I had lived, the carvings of birds I had made, and a strand of my wife’s hair. Was this vision a symptom of my hunger? It couldn’t be. I had survived many days at sea bereft of anything to assuage the needs of my body. This was something else, something momentous. It must have been the stone mirror she had mentioned. I resisted the urge to alert my companion to my discovery before the allotted time had passed. Hunger continued to assail me. I was too weak to stand. A puddle of bile snaked up my throat. I shuddered. 

Once I was reasonably sure a half hour had passed, I reached out to the wall that had briefly shimmered, hoping to find a logical explanation for its behavior. To the best of my knowledge, walls were not given to shimmering, not in Tlon nor in the Garden States where I had lived previously. My hand met a thin film of what appeared to be ooze but on withdrawing it from the wall, I could detect no residue, no odor or taste, nothing to indicate the truth of what I had just felt. 

“Death,” I said, naming the forbidden word.

“Death,” she replied. ‘You figured it out quicker than most do. We must not, in this land, talk about either Death or its opposite for fear of the Ibadhi punishment of bez’ban or tongue-loss. Well then, we have much to talk about. You had in your possession the Book of the Living. Is that correct?” 

I looked up from my famished belly. “Yes,” I said. “How did you know?”

“Because I too once possessed the Book of the Living but it was taken from me before I could truly understand its meaning. Its removal from my life caused me to take certain violent actions.”

“Such as?”

“After reading about the horror of my existence during the first year of my post-life, I came to certain conclusions. The Book, tailored to me, just as it would be tailored to you, provided the specifics of my particular sin though of course I forgot what those were the minute I closed the book. Annihilation occurred to me then as not something to fear but to aspire to in this condition, for if I remedied my particular sin, then I would be truly free. The Book, however, was stolen from me. Thankfully, I’d had the presence of mind to make notes which the thief had overlooked. Let me say simply, I attempted to put an end to my post-life. I invented a machine that drilled a hole into my brain every morning at six am, returning me to a comatose state. As this is Tlon, where no man or woman may speak of _____ or commit to an act oriented towards _____, such an act was deemed illegal. My friend, who I had entrusted with paying my rent for all of eternity so that I may enjoy my infinite coma, well, what can I say? Five years later, he neglected to pay the rent and my fine scheme was at an end. Now, I languish. All of us here are those that have committed the heresy of trying to reach the true Death.”

Pain dug its claws into my sides. “A fascinating story, to be sure, but I have no memory of trying to end myself. I hadn’t even attempted to seriously read from the Book of the Living. It was merely bequeathed to me by a friend.”

“I see. I see.”

“How did you know my name?”

There was a long pause before she answered. “I guessed, and in this universe, I happened to be correct. Believe me, I am not quite so lucky in other universes.”

Long years at sea had convinced me of the futilities of such theories. Yet, I decided to humor her. “In other universes, you may have become the first woman to successfully exit the post-life.”

She let loose a sound that was almost a sigh. “Oh, how I long for that universe to be,” she said. “It has been at least a decade and I confess I am no closer to figuring out the method one exits the post-life. One must assume it requires contemplation of the forbidden word as well as some method of atoning for one’s original sin.”

I peered once again through the bars of my cell. I could hear the sounds of low voices speaking on a variety of subjects, most of which were obscure to me. Occasionally, a hand would reach out from one of the hexagonal cells and gesture frantically, though who they were gesturing to was never clear. Where were the guards? What manner of prison was this? “It is exceedingly strange to me how we are yet to see any guards,” I said. “What manner of institution is this, Miss Velazquez?”
I could picture her face as I spoke her name, which I had not previously known. She was slight, with hooded green eyes, and a shock of red hair. It seemed to me that perhaps I’d known her once, in life, or perhaps made her acquaintance somewhere in the vastness of the post-life.

“I see that in this universe, we are meant to know each other’s names,” she said. “Sara, please, call me Sara. The guards are not very concerned about us, Harmon. They are here, believe me. Some days when we least expect it, they come bearing food. Aside from that kindness, they leave us to ourselves for the most part, unless we speak the forbidden word while they can hear us. We are merely heretics. We possess no great energy with which to shake the system, but we are exceedingly important for the purpose of their research. They wish us to understand the secret of the stone mirror. They believe it may be a portal or a library of some kind left behind by their precursors but as their faith will not permit them to consider matters of life and death, it is left up to heretics such as ourselves to do so. In fact, the Ibadhis would much rather we succeed at our heresy so they may then embrace it with no shame. All religions, even here, desperately seek the way out of their own constraints, do they not?”

“I don’t follow.”

“Sometimes, when one speaks of Death with the purest of intentions, the Mirror shimmers.”

“Can one go through?”

“We’ve all tried but none have succeeded.”

“Why then are we here?”

“These are my premises, Harmon. One: all these people believed in their God while they were alive. Two: they continue to believe in Him even though it is abundantly clear that their belief cannot be rationally justified. Three: these are a people, like any other people, primarily concerned with saving face. Four: does it not follow that they would prefer either for their God to present Himself as concrete, irrefutable proof, given that we’re here for all eternity, or for those like us to discover what lies beyond Death even? Isn’t true Death the purpose of all belief?”
“I suppose I understand your premises. So we are not prisoners then, but monks.”

“In a manner of speaking. This explains why the guards do not show themselves. They would prefer we spend our days in silent contemplation of the sixth wall of the cell.”

“Why?”

“Beyond the sixth wall, their Gnostic scriptures say, is true Death, the true extinction of the Mind. Some call it Heaven. It is said that they constructed each of these cells with one wall containing a piece of a holy relic. Some nonsense about how only the condemned may find the truth, let me tell you. And believe me, we are condemned. We ought to harbor no illusions on that front. Flores in Cell 28 has been in here for almost one thousand years. He hasn’t spoken once in the time I’ve been here but that’s what they say. And you and I will be here forever, just like Flores, and I expect to go insane much sooner than he did. Nothing to look forward to, let me tell you.”
The knot of pain in my belly loosened. Transformed into something approaching dread, it moved up into my chest. “You mean, no one has ever escaped?”

“Not that I know of.”

“Averroes in Cell 41 believes that by staring at the Wall for long enough, the true reason for our post-lives will be revealed. That’s what the Ibadhis are after. They expect that at some point, God will speak through one of us, provided we don’t pass through the portal. All a bunch of bull, really. Averroes’ theory is that in all our human lives, we commit one sin that we spend our lifetimes trying to correct. If we do not rectify the consequences of the one sin, or even properly identify it, we are doomed to live forever in the post-life. Those of us who came closest to identifying the sin found themselves somehow in possession of the Book of the Living. Regret is the mechanism through which one enters the state beyond the post-life. A person filled with specific regret is a person who truly wants what lies on the other side of the post-life. That’s the theory anyway.”

“I don’t understand. Only one sin? Surely, I’ve more. I lived a heinous life. A warrior’s life. I hewed men’s heads with my sword, chopped into their trunks as if they were trees. I gathered virgin blood in the Great Purging so that my Mistress may bathe in it and preserve her youth. No, Sara, there must be more. One sin does not a life make.”

“It is what the Ibadhis believe.”

“How do you know all this? How do you communicate with the other prisoners?”

“By means of light. At night, we darken the torches in our cell corresponding to the Morse Code. Pass your hand over the flame quickly or slowly, depending on what you would like to say. Unfortunately, as we are situated within a hexagon, only those within the three cells directly opposite you may be signaled in this manner.”

“And I presume they will then signal you.”

“Correct. It isn’t very efficient but as you will notice, the Ibadhis are rather strict about our code of silence. We are to spend six days of the week in silent contemplation.”

The rest of her words were blanketed by a low drone that issued from the central staircase. In a matter of seconds, I had the sensation of that drone crawling into my very bones, vibrating uncertainly before I was comfortable.

“What’s that noise?” I yelled.

“The call for silence. Next week,” she yelled back.

For the next few days, I studied the opaque wall. I patted its surface, prodded the stone with my forefinger, whispered softly and inaudibly to it, sang soundless songs to it about places that I had never been. The humming made speech impossible. I could not hear myself over the droning white noise that seemed to be everywhere in my cell. Even so, I attempted to make the mirror shimmer with my heartfelt regret. Six days, she’d said, and so I waited, my insides burning with the desire to speak, to be heard, to be understood by this woman, who was also a prisoner. I considered the sum of my life’s sins but they were opaque to me, just as the wall was, just as the faint shades of my wife and son were. Furthermore, I could not say what exactly a sin was. Against what standard was I supposed to measure virtue? Who had I sinned against, if it were even possible to sin? The Ibadhi God? I knew nothing of Him. Surely, I could not be held to those standards. 

Every night, I would receive messages from the other prisoners. Some of the messages were limericks, others blasphemies that repeated the forbidden word _____ in its many iterations. More and more, I grew curious why the Ibadhis had banned the word itself. Why that word and that word alone? What power did it hold over them? Surely, _____ was something we had all experienced in order to enter the post-life.

I marked time by cutting notches into the chair. On the second day, an Ibadhi guard brought with him a plate of chicken on a bed of rice. I dug in, ate with my hands. A half hour later, he returned bearing water with which to wash myself. The sensual pleasure of it was overwhelming. Even my dreams were of water. On the fourth day of my incarceration, my dreams grew powerfully erotic. The white noise fashioned itself into Sara’s image overlaid on top of my wife’s body which then pressed itself into my lap, where she broke like a wave. I composed for this image-Sara a poem, a version of which I had once written for my wife. The translation goes something like this: 
I turn left, always I turn left.
The road is narrow; it smells of old coffee left out in the sun.
I resist the urge to stop, I keep turning left.
Eventually, there is a hill. The circle becomes wider. I travel through open country.
At the bottom of this hill, on the other side, the woman I will always love.
I ride past her, but not without first turning left.

Listen: her high voice calling me over the wind to remind me of the country that I will also have left.

On the sixth day of my incarceration, the humming died down. I had never been gladder for my tongue, my faculty of speech.

“What’s stopping us all from using another word in place of _____?” I asked Sara. “Perhaps we could call _____ breakfast instead.”

“You think we haven’t tried that? A decade or so ago, Albatin began to use the word “love” to describe _____. He’s a bit of an odd bird like that. For many years, the Ibadhis banned that word too. They can hear us, you know. I have reason to believe they record all our conversations.”
“Is love still forbidden?” I asked.

“It never quite caught on,” she replied.  “Once Albatin went mad, the rest of us abandoned our usage of the word. Besides, love is nothing like _____. It might even be its opposite. In any case, you won’t find it here.”

I thought then of the child and what it had said in the moments before I blacked out. “A child took my copy of the Book from me. It wanted to know if I had read from mine. I want to ask you, have you read from yours?”

“Of course. I read it cover to cover on the first day I got it. It’s all a bunch of gibberish once you get past the part that’s personalized for you. Chock-full of contradictions. It made sense to me many years ago when I was more attuned to that sort of narrative. Each chapter criticizes the one before it as chicanery and tomfoolery until the manuscript itself devolves into criticism of criticism of criticism of criticism, ad nauseum. You can find copies in museums still, I imagine.”
“What makes it special then, that a child would recognize it within my possessions, and steal only that?”

“I have no idea. Perhaps the child works for a rare book dealer though I’d hardly characterize that volume as being especially rare. Unusual in certain other countries, no doubt, but not in Tlon. The Ibadhis believe that every instant changes the fabric of time, and thus the world is recreated constantly. They believe that their God has not willed true _____ to anyone, however much one may wish it, that we are not to question his will. It is why they banned the word so that we may stop considering the blasphemy of it. Why do you suppose they say God Willing to everything and commit to nothing?”

“I have an idea.”

“Because all the infinite possibilities that exist within this particular moment are destroyed when this moment ends and another is spawned to take its place,” she said. “Every instant is its own universe, do you see? We’re just used to having the universe that follows this instant remain consistent with the universe that was part of this instant. Because that is God’s will. What if, instead, I were to stop speaking, and you were to find yourself at the seashore? Or if you were returned to the scene of your greatest sin in order to change the course of history which you would then realize is more malleable than you could imagine? Would you find that unbelievable?”
“No more unbelievable than being imprisoned in a high tower in Tlon, I suppose.”

“The Ibadhis believe their God is the glue that ensures the consistency of our world and enables us to live this reality. Their God has to will it for the next instant to play out.”

“I’m beginning to understand. What do you suppose was your one sin?” I asked.

“Oh, I have a few,” she said. 

“But if you had to say?”

“I don’t like talking about it.”

“But you will.”

“Yes, I will.”

“Good.”

“I gave away my daughter when she was only a few days old. If I had to say, that would be it. It was so long ago I’ve forgotten the circumstances.”


“It doesn’t seem to me, however, that it counts as a sin of any kind.”
“I made sure to give her away to a loving family, an architect couple from Florida, who took good care of her. While I was alive, anyway. Other than that, I lived a fairly blameless existence. I provided for my parents when they got old, my sister when she got sick, completed all the tasks that a person is meant to complete to be remembered as truly “good.” I’ve racked my brains for years trying to come up with something more meaningfully evil but I’m yet to come up with anything. You’re lucky in that way, Harmon, because my regret is so general it has become meaningless.”

“How do you mean?”

“You seem to have such an impressive resume of sins. Surely, you can skim the pages until you find the right one. Test them all out on the stone mirror. Let it shimmer. Maybe you’ll be the lucky one.”

“I was a warrior in the court of the Tyrant Queen,” I said. “A litany would be insufficient to catalog my wrongdoings. Nearer still, I found myself fantasizing about you, who I have never met. Surely, that’s a sin.”

I heard the beginnings of a giggle in her voice. “Thank you,” she said. “It is nice to be thought of that way. It has been very long. After awhile, one forgets the body’s needs, you know? Remind me. What do you look like?”

“Me? I have a face like a sailor from the Garden States. I appear to be a man in my late forties, stocky, with matted dark hair that reaches down to my shoulders. Tlon is not where one would ordinarily find a man such as myself.”

“A sailor. That’s fascinating.”

“I’m afraid it’s not very fascinating. In fact, it’s rather monotonous. Still, one should never complain about freedom, I suppose.”

“I dream of freedom sometimes. Of transforming with another into a bird and flying out of this coop.”

“Perhaps, we may yet do that. What is there to prevent the universe created in the very next instant from transforming us into birds?”

She laughed. “What did you see in your stone mirror? Did you see me?”

I recounted to her then the shimmering I had seen. “I saw within it a shimmer,” I said, “no, not just a shimmer but a whisper from a world beyond our own.”

“Tell me more.”

“You were in it,” I lied.

“Really?”

“Yes.”

“What was I doing?”

“It only lasted a mere second, perhaps two, before it was gone, faded into nothingness. It was as if the wall were a pool of clear water and with my gaze, I had somehow unsettled it, caused it to ripple. Peering through the water, I could see clear to the bottom, where I caught a glimpse of a bustling metropolis clotted with tourists. Great fishes many feet in length swam easily through this city, shuffled through the same doors as the men and women. You were standing on the other side of a great promenade from me. We were walking, about to find each other for the first time.”

My wife, how I had loved her, she who looked like a rumpled traveler at the end of a long journey, how I’d struggled to find her and how I’d lost her in death. I’d sworn my love to her for all time. 

“Is that what you suppose true _____ is like?” Sara’s voice asked me. “A surreal afterlife where one is finally free of regret?”

“It does sound a little absurd, doesn’t it?”

I considered the fiction I had recounted to Sara, how like the truth it was. In fact, it was inseparable from the truth. A manipulative truth. How much I yearned for a love like that once again. This fiction. Bloodless, because rain and time had washed that which was human from my telling.

For the majority of the following week, I ignored the stone mirror and instead considered the birds that perched on the parapets of the prison. I watched their bodies hang low over the windowsill, perfectly suspended, their white wings barely fluttering. I transmitted to the other prisoners a poem I’d composed recounting the transformation we would have to make as we shed our human bodies and emerged as birds. In the dim darkness, I watched the poem make its rounds through the prison. With each telling, I watched the words of the poem change until they resembled those of the poem I had composed to Sara’s image. On the Day of Speech, Sara recited it to me verbatim.  When she was finished, she told me it was lovely.

“It has been many years since we’ve felt hope in this prison, Harmon. You did not mention that you were a poet.”

The following Wednesday, I saw the child again, the one that had led me to this prison. To my horror, he was being led to a cell in the far corner by two cloaked figures. Slumped forward in the manner of a whipped dog, I had the sense that I had known him in life somehow, a thought which brought me no end of regret. His post-life, squandered, just as mine was. “Hey, hey,” I called, but no audible sound would issue from my mouth over the drone that made audible communication impossible during the week. 

On the child’s face, I saw a familiar fear, the fear of a child about to have its throat cut, a very specific fear, and I knew then that the child was my son. In the Book were the details of my son’s life, the life I had not had the opportunity to be a part of. But that was not all. In my son’s quivering lips, I saw the Ibadhi truth, that a man’s life was nothing more than a series of instants and that life was eternal because no  matter where one’s consciousness may be, there was always an instant before and after, and with that came the terrible burden of love and family, of the absolute need to hold reality close to the chest, to not let go and through this knowledge, I knew I had failed him in every way because he had lived many instants without me, too many, too many to bear, and so on the night before my final voyage, the night before the barbarians invaded our City, I myself had killed them both, my wife and son, slain them with my scimitar and I recalled and recalled and oh love, my well-deserved punishment. I could not escape the post-life so long as the regret still held sway over me. It was not death I was to confront in my isolation, but something else entirely. Life. A scream issued from my throat that I had no desire to temper. “Oh my life,” I yelled and wailed a terrible keening sound, like an albatross trapped above a sea of pain, that could be heard over the drone.

I could see torches flickering all over the prison. Sara was trying to send me a message. “Are you well?” she wanted to know. “I hear you.”

But all I could see was the boy, who had his face to me for just an instant. His gaze filled me with shame and regret and thus the secret of the Stone Mirror was revealed to me before he was herded into a cell opposite mine.

A few minutes later, an Ibadhi guard entered my cell and cut off my tongue with his scimitar. “Blasphemer,” he said.

I realized then I had uttered the true forbidden word, the only word that could be heard over the infinite drone of the post-life. Death was nothing, a false mirror. And then it became clear to me: the real forbidden word was not death, but “life.” Death was only a distraction of no real consequence, the post-life merely a crucible where one is purified of life’s regrets. A year has passed since that day. I knew then, close as I was to truth, I could never go back to it, unable to utter the word into the mirror, which has stared blankly at me since.

Life. I have not spoken the word once. Nor attempted to signal it to anyone, not even Sara. Even writing the word pains me.
