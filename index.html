title: "Writing Samples"
---

<p>An attempt to consolidate a few years worth of blog posts. These are straws pulled at semi-random so pardon their lack of thematic cohesion. Eventually, I'll migrate more posts here. For now, this is just an indicator of what I blog about/writing samples.

There's some fiction in there also.
